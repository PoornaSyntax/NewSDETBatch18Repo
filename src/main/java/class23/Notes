LinkedList:

Set:
   Sets are very similar to list but they do not allow
   duplicate elements.
HashSet:
   UpSide:
   Its Fast.
   DownSide:
   They do not store the data in order.
LinkedHashSet:
   UpSide:
      It remembers the order.
   DownSide:
      Its slower than HashSet.
TreeSet:
   UpSide:
       It keeps the data sorted always
   Downside:
       Inserting new elements  is very slow
