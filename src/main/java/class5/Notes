Logical operators:
    Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.
    This is the third set of operators(Symbols) that we are
    discussing now. We have already discussed Arithmetic and
    relational operators. These are the symbols that we use for
    logical operators in java (||,&&,!).
Not(!):
    Not Operator is going to reverse the condition. if condition
    is true its gonna make it false and if condition is false
    its gonna make it true.
Why should we use NOT !:
    When we have an uneven set we can ise the NOT ! to
    simplify our if conditions.
 Logical OR(||) operator :
    When we have to combine multiple conditions in such
    way that as soon as one conditions becomes false overall
    result is false. It only returns true when all the conditions
    are true.
 Switch statemens:
      Switch statements are basically same as else if statements
      but they give us better performance but it is also very limited.
