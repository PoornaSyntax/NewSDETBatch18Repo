Methods in Java:
     Methods/Function/Behaviour are blocks of code
     They contain statement(lines of code) which are
     executed when a method is called.
     A method i java has a return type (output) name and arguments(inputs).

     Why should we use methods?
        Methods help us reuse the code. When we need to share/reuse a
        piece of code within out project or with others we can
        create our own classes define methods inside those classes
        and we start reusing/sharing them.

     Syntax of the method:
        returnType(output) nameOfTheMethod (input/arguments/parameters){

        }
