Arrays
Arrays are collection of items. Items are
stored based on the indexes. When we store
the first item an index zero is assigned toit.
we can use this index to access the elements
back from the array.

Why we should learn arrays:
With the help of array, it is possible
to store and manipulate large amounts of data
using loops which was not possible with variables
Limitations of Enhanced for loop:
1 We can't skip items.
2 We can't go in backward direction.
3 We can't upodate the item in the array.

2D Arrays:
  2D array is a collection of multiple 1D arrays.
  iD array is a collection of multiple items.
  For 2D arrays we write two [][]

  why should we learn about 2D:

  2D arrays help us to store the data in the form of tables
  like storing and manipulating the data from Excel files
 shortcuts:
 1 Iter to write an enhanced for loop
 2 fori for a normal for loop
