Abstracion in Java:
    Abstract means something which is not clear
    or not complete. We use abstraction to create
    methods which are incomplete meaning they do not
    have a body, they only have method headers.
Why should we create abstract methods?
   1. When we know that every child will be overridig
   a method we don't need to hava a method body.
   2. It acts as a template when we create a method as
   abstract every child must provide body for that.
   It is used to enforce methods on the child classes.
Interfaces:
   Interface something which is common in two systems. It is
   like a contract that helps us know what type of methods
   should be present in a class
