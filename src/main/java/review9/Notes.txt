Polymorphism:
   It's a mechanism in java that allows the methods
   to behave differently depending upon which object
   are using to call them. There are two types of
   polymorphism dynamic and static.
   Dynamic polymorphism is achieved through method overriding.
   static Polymorphism is achieved through method overloading.
Why should we use Polymorphism:
   It allows us to avoid code repetition. If we have to call
   multiple methods from multiple classes, and they are all sibling classes.

What do we need to apply Polymorphism.
   1. inheritance
   2. Method overriding
   3. Type casting
   4. loops
   5. Arrays.
Interface:
   Interfaces are like contracts which makes sure that everybody is on
   the same page.
