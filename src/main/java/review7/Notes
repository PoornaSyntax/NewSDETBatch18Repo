Methods:
a block of code that performs a specific action
when called. In Java methods can only exit inside a
class. If the method is instance method we need to create
the object of the class to call if method is static we
use the name of the class.method.name.
Benefit :
  They allow us to reuse code.
Types of method:
    1. method with void return type
    2.methods with specific return types

Task
Create a method which will take an array of integers as
input and going to return the sum of all the numbers
from the input array

How do we know whe we should create a static variable:
   Whenever we want to store something that is universals(Constants) and
   it does usually change we can safely go and create a static variable
