Types of variables:
   There are three types of variables in java
   with respect to scope/visibility/accessibility
   1. local 2. instance 3. static
Local Variable:
   Local variables are the variables which are defined inside
   the block of code like if-else statement, loop, switch-statement
   methods. They can only be accessed with-in the block of code.
UpSide:
   They occupy the momory least amount of time inside your computer.
   you should always try to go with local variables.
DownSide:
    They can only be accessed within the same block where they are created.
Instance Variables:
   The variables which are defined inside a class but outside of a block of code
   like method, if-else statement, loop, switch etc, Are called as instance variables
   They can be accessed anywhere in the class except static methods.
UpSide:
   They can be accessed anywhere inside a class other than static methods.
DownSide:
   They occupy the memory for longer as compared to a local variable.


static Variables:
    Static variables are created using static keyword they are also created outside of
    blocks of code like methods, loops etc.
UpSide:
    we can save a lot of space because for static only one memory location is used
    for all the objects.

DownSide:
    It occupies the memory for longest.
Tasks:
Create a static method with int return type call it dValue which takes a number as input
multiplies it by 2 and returns the value.


AccessModifiers:
     Access modifiers in Java help us control who can access what. There are 4 access
     levels and we use three keywords to control these levels. private, default, protected and public
Private :
     Is the most restricted one when used with a variable or method those can't be accessed ouside the class
Important note:
     1. 99% of the methods are public.
     2. 99% of the instance fields are created as private.
     3. 99% of static fields are public.
     4. 99% of the time class are also public
